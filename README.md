# it has 3 section:
# My child is missing- where citizens can report missing children.
# Here is a sighted child - where citizens can report sightings and whereabouts of missing children without wasting much time.
# Search a missing child and the found children can also be reported on it. The reporting of the missing person on the KhoyaPaya site can be done through text, photographs, videos, or any other means of transmitting and uploading information.
# The website shall help in providing the links to the court orders. Whereas police have the authorization to register an FIR in the matter of a child gone missing. They too have the authority to treat it as either abduction or trafficking unless it is proved otherwise in the investigation
